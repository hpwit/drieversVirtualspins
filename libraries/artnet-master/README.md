# Artnet

An Art-Net library for Teensy and Arduino

Also supports Arduino Zero, ESP8266 and ESP32 based boards

Note: this library assumes you are using the standard Ethernet library

## Installation

You can download the [master](https://github.com/natcl/Artnet/archive/master.zip) and place the folder in your `~/Documents/Arduino/libraries` folder.

## Examples

Different examples are provided, here is a summary of what each example does.

### ArtnetNeoPixel

This example will receive multiple universes via Artnet and control a strip of ws2811 leds via Adafruit's [NeoPixel library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel).

### ArtnetNeoPixelSD

Same as above but with controls to record and playback sequences from an SD card. To record, send 255 to the first channel of universe 14. To stop, send 0 and to playback send 127.  The limit of leds seems to be around 450 to get 44 fps. The playback routine is not optimzed yet.

### ArtnetOctoWS2811

This example will receive multiple universes via Artnet and control a strip of ws2811 leds via Paul Stoffregen's excellent [OctoWS2811 library](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_OctoWS2811.html).

### ArtnetReceive

This is a basic example that will print out the header and the content of an ArtDmx packet.  This example uses the read() function and the different getter functions to read the data.

### ArtnetReceiveCallback

This is similar to ArtnetReceive but uses a callback to read the data.
